## How does it work?
Script doenloads the latest version of the `xremap` remapper for your architecture. Configuration file `config.yaml` contains majority of the remapping instructions. On top of that the default GNOME shell and Mutter keybindings are modified. A systemd service is created and enabled for a particular user. Therefore after the install other users on the system will not be affected by the remap. 

## Prerequisities
