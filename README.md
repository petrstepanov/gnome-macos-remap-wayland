# GNOME → macOS Keyboard Remap for Wayland

This keyboard remap is based on the [Xremap](https://github.com/k0kubun/xremap) functionality and works with Wayland and Xorg.

## How does it work?
Script downloads the latest version of the `xremap` remapper for your architecture. Configuration file `config.yml` contains majority of the remapping instructions. On top of that the default GNOME shell and Mutter keybindings are modified. A systemd service is created and enabled for a particular user. Therefore after the install other users on the system will not be affected by the remap. 

## Prerequisities
* Install Git and GNOME extensions `sudo <your-package-manager> install git gnome-shell-extensions`.
